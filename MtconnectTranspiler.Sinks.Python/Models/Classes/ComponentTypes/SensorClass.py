&#10;&#10;&#10;Description&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;If modeling individual sensors, then sensor should be associated with the {{block(Component)}} that the measured value is most closely associated.

When modeled as an {{block(Auxiliary)}}, sensor **SHOULD** represent an integrated {{term(sensor unit)}} system that provides signal processing, conversion, and communications. A {{term(sensor unit)}} may have multiple {{termplural(sensing element)}}.

See {{block(SensorConfiguration)}} for more details on the use and configuration of a {{block(Sensor)}}.&#10;
